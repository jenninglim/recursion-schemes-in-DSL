# Scheming it all: Recursion Schemes in DSL

## Brief

An in-depth analysis of the catamorphism from a categorical-theoretic perspective.
It uses the basics of category theory to streamline the derivation of the catamorphism
as a homomorphism between F-algebras.

This report will delves into the weird and wonderful world of category theory. It shows
that even with its abstract nature, it has very practical implications. Including further
developing its algebra.

## Abstract
This report discusses structured recursion to derive program semantics. In particular, the denotational semantics which can be structured as a fold motivates a close examination of its generalised notion as a recursive operation: the catamorphism.
